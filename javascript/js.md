  <summary>Why javascript is single threaded?</summary>
   JavaScript is designed as a single-threaded language primarily for simplicity and to avoid the complexities associated with multithreading in a browser environment.

Here are the key reasons:

- **Original Purpose and Simplicity**: When JavaScript was initially created, its primary role was to add interactivity to web pages within a single browser window. For this purpose, a single-threaded model was sufficient and significantly simpler to implement and reason about compared to managing multiple threads, synchronization, and potential race conditions.
- **Avoiding Concurrency Issues**: Multithreaded environments introduce challenges like race conditions and deadlocks when multiple threads try to access and modify shared resources simultaneously. By being single-threaded, JavaScript inherently avoids these complex concurrency issues, making it easier for developers to write predictable code without needing to implement explicit locking mechanisms or complex synchronization patterns for most operations.
- **The Event Loop and Asynchronous Operations**: While JavaScript is single-threaded, it achieves non-blocking I/O and the appearance of concurrency through the Event Loop. The JavaScript engine (like V8 in Chrome) offloads time-consuming tasks (like network requests, timers, or DOM manipulations) to Web APIs (in browsers) or the Node.js C++ API. When these asynchronous tasks complete, their callbacks are placed in a queue, and the Event Loop pushes them onto the call stack for execution only when the main thread is idle. This allows the single thread to remain responsive and handle other tasks while waiting for long-running operations to finish.
- **Browser Environment Constraints**: In a browser, directly manipulating the Document Object Model (DOM) from multiple threads simultaneously could lead to inconsistencies and complex synchronization problems. A single-threaded model simplifies DOM manipulation and ensures a consistent state.

While JavaScript is single-threaded in its core execution model, modern JavaScript environments (like browsers and Node.js) offer mechanisms like Web Workers (in browsers) or Worker Threads (in Node.js) to enable true parallel execution for computationally intensive tasks by creating separate, isolated execution environments, thereby overcoming the limitations of the single-threaded nature for specific use cases.

  <summary>How single-threaded JavaScript handles multiple tasks?</summary>
  Despite its single-threaded nature, JavaScript is not inefficient. It achieves high-performance concurrency for non-blocking tasks, like fetching data from an API or responding to a user click, through a sophisticated system that includes the event loop, callback queues, and Web APIs.
  
  Here is a step-by-step breakdown of how this process works:
  - **The Call Stack**: All synchronous code is executed here, one function at a time in a Last-In, First-Out (LIFO) order. When a function finishes, it is "popped" off the stack.
  - **Offloading to Web APIs**: When the JavaScript engine encounters an asynchronous operation—such as setTimeout(), fetch(), or a DOM event listener—it does not wait for it to complete. Instead, it offloads the operation to a Web API (or C++ API in Node.js) to run in the background.
  - **The Callback Queue**: Once the Web API finishes its task, it places the callback function (the code to be run next) into a queue. There are separate queues for different types of tasks, including higher-priority "microtasks" (like Promises) and lower-priority "macrotasks" (like timers).
  - **The Event Loop**: This constantly-running process checks if the call stack is empty. If it is, the event loop takes the first item from the queue and pushes it onto the call stack for execution. 
  
  This mechanism ensures that computationally intensive background tasks do not block the main thread, keeping the application responsive.
  
  e.g.
  ```javascript
  console.log("Start");

setTimeout(() => {
console.log("This is asynchronous.");
}, 2000);

console.log("End");

```
**Output:**
```

Start
End
This is asynchronous.

````

**In this example:**

- The first console.log("Start") is executed and removed from the stack.
- The setTimeout() function is encountered and placed in the call stack. It sets the callback function to await in the Web API (which handles the asynchronous operation), then the setTimeout() function is popped off the stack.
- The third console.log("End") is pushed onto the stack and executed, and then it's popped off.
- After 2 seconds, the callback function passed to setTimeout() is moved to the Callback Queue (or Event Queue), where it waits for the call stack to be empty.
- The Event Loop checks if the call stack is empty. Once it is, the callback function is pushed to the call stack, executed, and printed as "This is asynchronous".

<summary>What are the Callbacks, Promises, and Async/Await?</summary>
JavaScript uses `callbacks`, `promises`, and `async/await` to manage asynchronous operations efficiently without blocking the execution of other tasks.

- **Callbacks:** These are functions passed as arguments to other functions that execute once the asynchronous operation is complete. The event loop manages when to call the callback.
- **Promises:** A promise represents the result of an asynchronous operation. It allows chaining of .then() methods to handle the result once it’s available, providing a more structured and readable way to manage asynchronous code.
```javascript
fetch('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts')
  .then(response => response.json())
  .then(data => console.log(data))
  .catch(error => console.log(error));
````

- **Async/Await:** Async/await is syntactic sugar over promises, making asynchronous code look more like synchronous code. It enables asynchronous code to be written in a more readable and sequential manner without blocking the main thread.

```javascript
async function fetchData() {
  try {
    let response = await fetch("https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts");
    let data = await response.json();
    console.log(data);
  } catch (error) {
    console.log(error);
  }
}
```

  <summary>What is debouncing in Javascript?</summary>

  This might not be asked directly like this, but may be in the form of `How you can avoid multiple calls with type ahead search?`. 
    Debouncing in JavaScript is a technique used to control the rate at which a function is executed, particularly when it's tied to events that can fire rapidly,    such as user input (typing, clicking), window resizing, or scrolling. The core idea is to delay the execution of a function until a certain amount of time has      passed since its last invocation. If the event triggers again within that delay period, the timer is reset, effectively preventing the function from being called   until a period of inactivity.
  How it works:
  - **Timer Management:** A setTimeout is used to schedule the function execution after a specified delay.
  - **Resetting the Timer:** Each time the debounced function is called (i.e., the event fires), any previously set setTimeout is cleared using clearTimeout, and a new timer is initiated.
  - **Execution on Inactivity:** The function is only actually executed if the specified delay elapses without any further invocations of the debounced function.

  ```javascript
  function debounce(func, delay) {
    let timeoutId; // This will store the ID of the timeout
  
    return function(...args) {
      // Clear any existing timeout to reset the timer
      clearTimeout(timeoutId);
  
      // Set a new timeout
      timeoutId = setTimeout(() => {
        // Execute the original function after the delay
        func.apply(this, args);
      }, delay);
    };
  }
  
  // Example usage:
  function handleSearchInput(query) {
    console.log("Searching for:", query);
    // In a real application, this might trigger an API call
  }
  
  const debouncedSearch = debounce(handleSearchInput, 500); // Debounce with a 500ms delay
  
  // Attach to an input field's 'input' event
  document.getElementById('myInput').addEventListener('input', (event) => {
    debouncedSearch(event.target.value);
  });
```

**Why use debouncing?**
- **Performance Optimization:** Prevents excessive function calls, especially for resource-intensive operations like API requests or DOM manipulations, improving application responsiveness.
- **Preventing Unwanted Behavior:** Ensures actions are taken only when a user has "finished" an interaction (e.g., stops typing before a search is performed).
- **Resource Management:** Reduces unnecessary processing and network requests, leading to more efficient use of system resources.

  <summary>What is polyfill in javascript?</summary>
  A polyfill in JavaScript is a piece of code that provides modern functionality to older browsers or environments that do not natively support it. Essentially,     it "fills in" the gaps in browser compatibility by implementing a missing feature using existing JavaScript capabilities.

  **Here's how it works:**
  - **Detection:** A polyfill first checks if a specific feature or API is available in the current browser environment.
  - **Implementation:** If the feature is missing, the polyfill provides a custom implementation of that feature, mimicking its behavior as closely as possible using the JavaScript features that are supported in that older environment.

  **Why are polyfills necessary?**
  Different web browsers and their versions have varying levels of support for JavaScript features and APIs. Newer features introduced in ECMAScript standards (like ES6, ES7, etc.) might not be natively supported in older browsers (e.g., Internet Explorer 11). Polyfills allow developers to use these modern features in their code while ensuring that the application still functions correctly in older environments, thus improving cross-browser compatibility and reducing development time.

  Consider the `Array.prototype.includes()` method, which was added in ECMAScript 2016. Older browsers like Internet Explorer 11 do not support it. A polyfill for `Array.prototype.includes()` would check if the method exists and, if not, provide a custom implementation using a loop and `indexOf()` to achieve the same functionality.

  ```Javascript
  if (!Array.prototype.includes) {
    Array.prototype.includes = function(searchElement, fromIndex) {
      if (this == null) {
        throw new TypeError('"this" is null or not defined');
      }
  
      var o = Object(this);
      var len = o.length >>> 0;
  
      if (len === 0) {
        return false;
      }
  
      var n = fromIndex | 0;
      var k = Math.max(n >= 0 ? n : len - Math.abs(n), 0);
  
      while (k < len) {
        if (o[k] === searchElement) {
          return true;
        }
        k++;
      }
      return false;
    };
  }
  ```

  <summary>What are the closures in javascript?</summary>
  In JavaScript, a closure is the combination of a function and the lexical environment within which that function was declared. This means that an inner function, even after its outer function has finished executing, still retains access to the outer function's variables and parameters.
  
  **Here are the key aspects of closures:**
- **Lexical Scoping:** JavaScript uses lexical scoping, meaning that the scope of a variable is determined by its position within the source code. An inner function has access to variables declared in its own scope, its outer (enclosing) function's scope, and the global scope.
- **Remembering the Environment:** When an outer function returns an inner function, the inner function "remembers" the lexical environment in which it was created. This environment includes all the variables and parameters that were in scope at the time of the inner function's creation.
- **Persistence of Variables:** Even after the outer function has completed its execution and its execution context is removed from the call stack, the variables it declared remain accessible to the inner function (the closure) as long as a reference to that inner function exists. This allows the inner function to continue to access and manipulate those variables.

  ```Javascript
    function createCounter() {
    let count = 0; // 'count' is a variable in the outer scope
  
    function increment() { // 'increment' is the inner function (the closure)
      count++;
      console.log(count);
    }
  
    return increment; // Return the inner function
  }
  
  const myCounter = createCounter(); // 'createCounter' finishes executing, but 'count' persists
  myCounter(); // Output: 1
  myCounter(); // Output: 2
  ```
  In this example, `increment` is a closure. Even after `createCounter()` has returned, `myCounter` (which is a reference to `increment`) can still access and modify the count variable from `createCounter`'s scope. This demonstrates how closures allow for data encapsulation and maintaining state across function calls.
